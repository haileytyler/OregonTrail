# Oregeon-Trail
This project was completed in a Software Development II class.  It recreates the popular 1970s game Oregon Trail, although it does not have the full functionality of the original game as it was not required.

If you want to test out my game make sure that your browser has local storage and autoplay enabled in order to play the music.  You will also need to install Node on your machine as the web server uses Node.js and the Express library.  Setting up a mysql database is optional and is only used to display the top ten scores.

Enjoy and good luck on the trail!
